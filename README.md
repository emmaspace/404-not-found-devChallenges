## Overview

Gif: ![Web page in Responsively gif](https://cdn.glitch.com/22b59d65-04e1-45a4-a1c9-23e737c2551c%2F404%20page%20not%20found.gif?v=1620349172097)

This is the first responsive website I make, so it was challenging to figure out how to style it keeping in mind the differences that were needed for different devides. This gave me a better perspective on how to plan and style a web page from zero.

I learned how to use media queries and I also practiced how to use flexbox and the grid as well as which tools where more convenient to use to achieve specific goals. I also learned how to make the html and the body of a document use all the space available so I could position other elements as needed.

This was a very good project to practice basics of CSS and to learn how and when to use flexbox and the grid, but the main goal was that I learned how to use media queries correctly.
